Please answer the following questions.

1. What is your name?
Afiq Amjad bin Khairir

2. How long did you work on this project?
The setting up, implementing CRUD operations and the filtering took about 45 minutes, whereas the frontend took another hour or so.

3. What is the most challenging part of the project?
    - I think since it was a while since I used Node.js and Express, having to refresh my memory on how things worked under a time constraint was definitely pressuring.
    - I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to do any frontend, but I decided to, so connecting the database with ejs and making everything work was also definitely something I was stressed about during the project.

4. What did you learn from this project?
    - One thing I learned from reading the reading the skeleteon code is that I can auto-create timestamps for CreatedAt and UpdatedAt. In the past I simply made separate attributes for those two and manually updated them whenever I updated a task.
    - It was also my first time using ejs, so I couldn't fully implement all the functionalities in terms of front end, but it was also a fun part to learn and see visually the project working.ÃŸ

5. What would you like to add or improve in this project?
    - It would be nice if there was a deadline/duration attribute where it shows when you need to get the task done by, as that would give users more incentive to finish the task when they can visibly see the deadline.
    - Along the same lines as the first part, color coding the task in accordance to importance could also drive the user to complete important tasks in a more efficient manner.
    - A trash route would also be good so that if a task is accidentally deleted a user can "restore" it, and if not, they can just permanently delete it.
    - Definitely just a more pleasing frontend.

6. What is your feedback on this project?
    - It was definitely a fun project to do, I loved making it.
    - time constraint was enough for me to implement the functionality.

7. What is your suggestion for this project?
    - I think clearer instructions in terms of what exactly is NOT needed (just the functionality, or frontend included)
    - Maybe less handholding in terms of maybe schema creation just so that we are able to do that ourselves from scratch too.
